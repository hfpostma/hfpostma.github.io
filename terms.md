I only do Drupal related projects.

My one man company is registered in Italy. I invoice my services. I do however accept payrolling if required.

Having an EU passport and company, I can be employed freelance in any member state without hassle.

For the US, Canada and Australia I am tied to the visa regulations. I can come over for a period of 90 days and be compensated for expenses only. I am available remote and open for proposals.


## On location

I have a daily all-in rate when working on location that does include accommodation and travel expenses. To cover for those, a probationary period of one month should be respected.

I can arrange initial accommodation myself through [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/7889468).


## 100 % remote

Work done from my office has a convenient rate.

It might be good to know I:

- am more productive in my own place
- have a dedicated office
- have no kids around
- adapt to your time zone when necessary.

When working remote I ask for:

- the availability of technical specifications
- the use of an issue tracker
- a central repository to push, Git or FTP
- appointment of a contact person, usually the PM
- a minimum of weekly conference meetings (VOIP).


## A combination

Sometimes it is required to remain available for maintenance work after project delivery. In that case we can start full-time on location and continue part-time remote.


## Training

Training programs are custom made and done on location company in-house. The normal daily rate applies plus expenses. It takes two days of preparation for each training day plus an additional two days for travelling.

Preliminary software download, install instructions and training material are to be made available to participants prior to the course acoording my instructions.


## My daily rate

Ask me. You will likely be positively surprised.
