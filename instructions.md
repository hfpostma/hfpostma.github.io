## Instructions how to publish to your [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) website hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/) using [Prose](http://prose.io/#hfpostma) with [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).

Described is just a user friendly way to edit and publish pages on your website. There are other ways to do the same thing.

*   After log in on GitHub go to [http://prose.io/#hfpostma/hfpostma.github.io](http://prose.io/#hfpostma/hfpostma.github.io).
*   All files that end with **.md** or **.html** are the texts of your siteâ€™s pages. **md** stands for [Markdown](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fdaringfireball.net%2Fprojects%2Fmarkdown%2Fsyntax&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEptifCNdy4hoJdAyCKUye3PfRngA) which is an easy-to-learn-and-read formatting language that can be interpreted by GitHub and many other applications as a popular standard for web publishers. The nice thing about it is that you can use normal HTML inside of it that will work as well. Thats nice for developers.
