## Instructions how to publish to your [Jekyll](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fjekyllrb.com%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNH7nDJRVmAc9lbjBVqHZmSaJKFdCA) website hosted on [GitHub](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHReqsuKT6C86HcgL4TbSevF24rxQ) using [StackEdit](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fstackedit.io%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHcaAbmEE6xgZ64etrya5GzDSOF4w) with [Markdown](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fdaringfireball.net%2Fprojects%2Fmarkdown%2Fsyntax&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEptifCNdy4hoJdAyCKUye3PfRngA).

This is just a user friendly (but amateuristic) way to edit and publish pages on your website. A ‘Pro’ would instead [install Git](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fhelp.github.com%2Farticles%2Fset-up-git%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNE1xwsS-KYAlqCpI7dSPQShCMOoSg)&nbsp;and use an editor like [https://atom.io/](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fatom.io%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNE0uG7SknFKYtIxXIWlCSDHYrqqJw)

*   After log in on GitHub open your site’s repository at [https://github.com/hfpostma/hfpostma.github.io](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fhfpostma%2Fhfpostma.github.io&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEMGD5lijo4poU9mPGXvk-eu68Bgw).
*   All files that end with **.md** or **.html** are the texts of your site’s pages. **md** stands for [Markdown](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fdaringfireball.net%2Fprojects%2Fmarkdown%2Fsyntax&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEptifCNdy4hoJdAyCKUye3PfRngA) which is an easy-to-learn-and-read formatting language that can be interpreted by GitHub and many other applications as a popular standard for web publishers. The nice thing about it is that you can use normal HTML inside of it that will work as well. Thats nice for developers. See also [https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fhelp.github.com%2Farticles%2Fmarkdown-basics&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFG7jdenrvrC1xKnX1uzbeJjY7lbg) and [https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
*   E.g. click on [index.md](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fhfpostma%2Fhfpostma.github.io%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2Findex.md&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFSmrOYhGE390kpa66gTZzoGl62fw)
*   You see more or less how the page would look like. To Edit click the pencil icon on the righthand top. You could make your changes directly here.


*   To see your changes live use a tool like [https://stackedit.io/editor](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fstackedit.io%2Feditor&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNG6IRdev2A-T9RL5iJ13m90okCHWw). Just copy and paste the code there.
*   Once you are done, open the # menu on the left >> Publish >> GitHub.
