## Instructions how to publish to your [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) website hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/) using [Prose](http://prose.io/#hfpostma) with [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).

For your convenience these instructions can be found also at [http://www.manfred.postma.website/instructions.html](http://www.manfred.postma.website/instructions.html). Make sure you bookmark it as no menu entry does exist to reach it otherwise.

Described is just a user friendly way to edit and publish pages on your website. There are other ways to do the same thing.

*   After log in on GitHub go to [http://prose.io/#hfpostma/hfpostma.github.io](http://prose.io/#hfpostma/hfpostma.github.io).
*   All files that end with **.md** or **.html** are the texts of your site’s pages. **md** stands for [Markdown](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fdaringfireball.net%2Fprojects%2Fmarkdown%2Fsyntax&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEptifCNdy4hoJdAyCKUye3PfRngA) which is an easy-to-learn-and-read formatting language that can be interpreted by GitHub and many other applications as a popular standard for web publishers. The nice thing about it is that you can use normal HTML inside of it that will work as well. Thats nice for developers. See also [https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/) and [https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
*   E.g. click on [index.md](https://github.com/hfpostma/hfpostma.github.io/blob/master/index.md)
*   You see more or less how the page would look like. To Edit click the eye icon on the righthand top. You could make your changes directly here.
*   Once you are done, click the _Save_ (disk) icon on the right and proceed with _Commit_.
